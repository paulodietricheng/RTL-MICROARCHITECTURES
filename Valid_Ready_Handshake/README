#Valid-Ready Pipeline Stage
The Valid–Ready Pipeline Stage is a single-entry buffer implementing a valid–ready handshake for FPGA streaming pipelines. It enables deterministic 
dataflow with backpressure propagation, ensuring no data loss and predictable latency, even when downstream stages stall.

This module is a fundamental building block for larger systems, such as trading pipelines, arbitration chains, and multi-stage streaming architectures

##Key features
  - Parametrizable, scaling to any data width `DATA_W`
  - Deterministic, producing the same output for the same set of inputs. 

##Use Cases
  - Skid buffer in high-frequency trading / low-latency pipelines
  - Interface to AXI-Stream
  - Pipeline Stage Buffering

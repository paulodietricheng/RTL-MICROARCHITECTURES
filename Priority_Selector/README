## Priority Selector
A priority selector is a hardware module that chooses one input from a set of multiple inputs based on a fixed priority. Each input has two signals: Data and Valid. Data is the actual payload of an input, and valid 
is a flag that indicates whether that payoad is meaningful or not. 

It works by analysing all N inputs simultaneously, and amongst the inputs with `valid = 1`, it selects the one with the highest priority (lowest index). It outputs the data of the selected input, the index of that 
input and the valid flag. 

Key characteristics of this module is: 
  - Parametrizable, Can scale to any number of inputs `N` and data width `DATA_W`
  - Deterministic, always producing the same output to the same set of inputs.
  - Scalable, Implemented as a logarithmic-depth reduction tree, so the number of comparison stages grows as O(log2 N).

Use cases:
  - Arbitration between multiple streams in FPGA trading pipelines
  - Selecting the first ready input in multi-source processing
  - Any system that needs low-latency decision making based on input validity

It had two versions, one fully pipelined, with registers at input, output and between each stage, and one mostly combnational, with registers only at input and output.
